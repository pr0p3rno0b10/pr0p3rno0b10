### Hi I am pr0p3rno0b.

I am aspiring to learn how to do code in Rust and the C languages.

Curent Projects:
 * Converting Minecraft to Ascii (really hard to explain)
   * In python using PIL
 * Making a website to sell my IGCSE notes to my peers
   * Using React with Materialize CSS for front end
   * Django for back-end
 * Trying to code games for a Casio FX-CG50
   * A mixture of python and C 
 
The only thing left to put in this bio is my favorite emoji: ðŸ’€
