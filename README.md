### Hi I am pr0p3rno0b.

I program in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Lua**, and **Java**.

I am aspiring to learn how to do code in Rust and the C languages.

Curent Projects:
 * Converting Minecraft to Ascii (really hard to explain)
 * Making a website to sell my IGCSE notes to my peers
 * Trying to code games for a Casio FX-CG50
 
The only thing left to put in this bio is my favorite emoji: ðŸ’€
